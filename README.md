# AI_crusade_forest_fire_detection
A computer vision model to detect forest fire and a hardware accelerated feedback system. 

- Fire.pt pytorch model fine tuned with yolov8n architecture. 
- Uses real time inference using cameras and detects forest fire. 
- Sends GPS coordinates, Forest fire images and alert feedbacks to the forest rangers or respective authorities. 
- Makes use of raspberry pi, A9G module and ESP32 for hardware accelerated feedback.
